"""
Generate 5000 synthetic IVF patient records for ML training.
This script creates realistic IVF success data with 8 features that match
the existing model structure in the application.

Features:
- age: Patient age (22-45)
- bmi: Body Mass Index (18-35)
- amh: Anti-Müllerian Hormone level (0.2-6.0 ng/mL)
- fsh: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (3-18 mIU/mL)
- previous_ivf: Number of previous IVF cycles (0-5)
- stress: Stress level (1-5)
- sleep_hours: Average sleep hours (4-9)
- exercise_min: Daily exercise minutes (0-60)
